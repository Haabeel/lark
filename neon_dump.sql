Let's break down each one:\n\n**1. `src/server/api/root.ts`:** This file acts as the main router, aggregating all other routers.\n\n```typescript\nexport const appRouter = createTRPCRouter({\n  auth: authRouter,\n  project: projectRouter,\n  image: imageRouter,\n});\n```\n\nIt combines `authRouter`, `projectRouter`, and `imageRouter` under the `appRouter`.  This allows clients to access all functionalities through a single entry point.\n\n**2. `src/server/api/routers/auth.ts`:** This router handles authentication-related operations.\n\n```typescript\nexport const authRouter = createTRPCRouter({\n  getSession: publicProcedure.query(async ({ ctx }) => { /* ... */ }),\n  sendVerificationEmail: secureProcedure\n    .input(z.object({ email: z.string().email(), otp: z.string().length(6) }))\n    .mutation(async ({ input }) => { /* ... */ }),\n});\n```\n\n*   `getSession`: A public procedure that retrieves the current user session.  It's accessible without authentication.\n*   `sendVerificationEmail`: A secure procedure requiring authentication (via API key) that sends a verification email with an OTP.  It uses Zod for input validation.\n\n**3. `src/server/api/routers/project.ts`:** This router manages project-related actions.\n\n```typescript\nexport const projectRouter = createTRPCRouter({\n  createProject: protectedProcedure\n    .input(z.object({ name: z.string(), description: z.string().optional(), githubUrl: z.string(), githubToken: z.string().optional() }))\n    .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => { /* ... */ }),\n  getProjects: protectedProcedure.query(async ({ ctx }) => { /* ... */ }),\n});\n```\n\n*   `createProject`: A protected procedure (requires user authentication) that creates a new project.  It uses Zod for input validation and handles database interaction.\n*   `getProjects`: A protected procedure that retrieves projects associated with the authenticated user.\n\n**4. `src/server/api/routers/image.ts`:** This router handles image migration.\n\n```typescript\nexport const imageRouter = createTRPCRouter({\n  migrateImage: protectedProcedure\n    .input(z.object({ userId: z.string(), provider: z.string(), externalUrl: z.string() }))\n    .mutation(async ({ input }) => { /* ... */ }),\n});\n```\n\n*   `migrateImage`: A protected procedure that migrates an image from an external URL to a backend service.  It uses Zod for input validation and interacts with a database and a backend client (`backendClient`).\n\n\nThese routers are accessed via the endpoint defined in `src/app/api/trpc/[trpc]/route.ts`, which uses `fetchRequestHandler` from `@trpc/server/adapters/fetch` to handle incoming requests.  The client-side interaction is facilitated by `src/trpc/react.tsx`, which provides React components and hooks for making tRPC calls.  The `src/trpc/server.ts` file handles server-side rendering aspects of tRPC.  The `DashboardProvider` in `src/providers/DashboardProvider.tsx` and the `Home` component in `src/app/page.tsx` demonstrate how these routes are used within the application.\n	[{"summary": "The code defines a tRPC API using `createTRPCRouter`.  `appRouter` aggregates routers for authentication (`authRouter`), projects (`projectRouter`), and images (`imageRouter`).  `AppRouter` exports the type definition for the entire API.  `createCallerFactory` is used to construct a server-side caller, providing a type-safe interface for interacting with the API from within the server itself. This design allows for easy expansion of API functionality through modular router definitions.\\n", "fileName": "src/server/api/root.ts", "similarity": 0.6767406255654919, "sourceCode": "import { createCallerFactory, createTRPCRouter } from \\"@/server/api/trpc\\";\\nimport { authRouter } from \\"./routers/auth\\";\\nimport { projectRouter } from \\"./routers/project\\";\\nimport { imageRouter } from \\"./routers/image\\";\\n/**\\n * This is the primary router for your server.\\n *\\n * All routers added in /api/routers should be manually added here.\\n */\\nexport const appRouter = createTRPCRouter({\\n  auth: authRouter,\\n  project: projectRouter,\\n  image: imageRouter,\\n});\\n\\n// export type definition of API\\nexport type AppRouter = typeof appRouter;\\n\\n/**\\n * Create a server-side caller for the tRPC API.\\n * @example\\n * const trpc = createCaller(createContext);\\n * const res = await trpc.post.all();\\n *       ^?

The relevant code snippet is:\n\n```typescript\nimport { db } from "@/server/db";\nimport { betterAuth } from "better-auth";\nimport { prismaAdapter } from "better-auth/adapters/prisma";\nimport { emailOTP } from "better-auth/plugins";\n\nexport const auth = betterAuth({\n  // ... configuration details ...\n});\n\nexport type Session = typeof auth.$Infer.Session;\n```\n\nAdditionally, the client-side configuration for `better-auth` is in `src/lib/auth-client.ts`.  This file sets up the client-side interaction with the `better-auth` server, defining the base URL and necessary plugins:\n\n```typescript\nimport { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";\nimport {\n  emailOTPClient,\n  inferAdditionalFields,\n} from "better-auth/client/plugins";\nimport { type auth } from "./auth";\n\nconst authClient = createAuthClient({\n  baseURL: process.env.BETTER_AUTH_URL,\n  plugins: [emailOTPClient(), inferAdditionalFields<typeof auth>()],\n});\n\n// ... export of client functions ...\n```\n\nFinally, the Next.js API routes that handle the requests are defined in `src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`:\n\n```typescript\nimport { auth } from "@/lib/auth"; \nimport { toNextJsHandler } from "better-auth/next-js";\n\nexport const { POST, GET } = toNextJsHandler(auth);\n```\n\nThese three files (`src/lib/auth.ts`, `src/lib/auth-client.ts`, and `src/app/api/auth/[...all]/route.ts`) collectively define the complete configuration and setup for `better-auth` within the application.\n	[{"summary": "This code configures authentication using the `better-auth` library.

using `react-hook-form` and `zod` for schema validation defined by `signUpSchema`.  It utilizes the `signUp.email` function (presumably from a client-side authentication library) to handle signup submission, and navigates to a verification page upon success.  State management uses `useState` for loading and `useToggle` for password visibility toggles.  UI elements include `Form`, `Button`, `FormInputField`, `SocialProviders`, and other components for layout and styling. The component includes a Next.js `Link` for navigation and displays an image. Error and success messages are provided via the `sonner` library's `toast` function.\\n", "fileName": "src/app/(auth)/sign-up/page.tsx", "similarity": 0.5167966473855665, "sourceCode": "\\"use client\\";\\nimport { signUpSchema } from \\"@/lib/validations/auth\\";\\nimport { useState } from \\"react\\";\\nimport { useForm } from \\"react-hook-form\\";\\nimport type z from \\"zod\\";\\nimport { zodResolver } from \\"@hookform/resolvers/zod\\";\\nimport { signUp, signIn } from \\"@/lib/auth-client\\";\\nimport { Form } from \\"@/components/ui/form\\";\\nimport { Button } from \\"@/components/ui/button\\";\\nimport { toast } from \\"sonner\\";\\nimport FormInputField from \\"@/components/shared/FormInputField\\";\\nimport SocialProviders from \\"@/components/shared/SocialProviders\\";\\nimport Link from \\"next/link\\";\\nimport Logo from \\"@/components/shared/Logo\\";\\nimport { LuMoveRight } from \\"react-icons/lu\\";\\nimport Image from \\"next/image\\";\\nimport signUpImage from \\"../../../../public/sign-in.png\\";\\nimport { Separator } from \\"@/components/ui/separator\\";\\nimport { useToggle } from \\"@/hooks/useToggle\\";\\nimport { useRouter } from \\"next/navigation\\";\\ntype SignUpForm = z.infer<typeof signUpSchema>;\\nconst SignUp = () => {\\n  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false);\\n  const [showPassword, setShowPassword] = useToggle(false);\\n  const [showConfirmPassword, setShowConfirmPassword] = useToggle(false);\\n  const router = useRouter();\\n  const form = useForm<SignUpForm>({\\n    resolver: zodResolver(signUpSchema),\\n    defaultValues: {\\n      email: \\"\\",\\n      password: \\"\\",\\n      confirmPassword: \\"\\",\\n      firstName: \\"\\",\\n      lastName: \\"\\",\\n    },\\n  });\\n\\n  const onSubmit = async (data: SignUpForm) => {\\n    setLoading(true);\\n\\n    try {\\n      const response = await signUp.email({\\n        email: data.email,\\n        password: data.password,\\n        name:\\n          data.lastName !== \\"\\"\\n            ?

To change the logo colors, you'll need to modify these `fill` attributes directly within the `Logo.tsx` file.\n\nHere's how the `fill` attributes are currently set:\n\n```jsx\n<path d="..." fill="#F7E9FA" />\n<path d="..." fill="#E8E9F7" />\n<path d="..." fill="#191EA0" />\n<path d="..." fill="#9E1EB8" />\n```\n\nTo change the colors, simply replace the hex color codes (`#F7E9FA`, `#E8E9F7`, `#191EA0`, `#9E1EB8`) with your desired hex codes, RGB values, or any other valid CSS color representation.  For example, to make all paths blue:\n\n```jsx\n<path d="..." fill="blue" />\n<path d="..." fill="blue" />\n<path d="..." fill="blue" />\n<path d="..." fill="blue" />\n```\n\nRemember to save the changes to `src/components/shared/Logo.tsx` and re-build your application to see the updated logo.  You can use a color picker tool to find hex codes for your desired colors.\n	[{"summary": "The React `Logo` component renders an SVG graphic representing a logo.

The project selection combobox fetches project data provided through props and utilizes  `setSelectedProject` to update the selected project.\\n", "fileName": "src/components/dashboard/AppSidebar.tsx", "similarity": 0.5137130161928024, "sourceCode": "\\"use client\\";\\nimport React, { type Dispatch, type SetStateAction } from \\"react\\";\\nimport {\\n  Sidebar,\\n  SidebarContent,\\n  SidebarFooter,\\n  SidebarGroup,\\n  SidebarGroupContent,\\n  SidebarGroupLabel,\\n  SidebarHeader,\\n  SidebarMenu,\\n  SidebarMenuButton,\\n  SidebarMenuItem,\\n  useSidebar,\\n} from \\"../ui/sidebar\\";\\nimport Logo from \\"../shared/Logo\\";\\nimport { Bot, LayoutDashboard, Presentation } from \\"lucide-react\\";\\nimport Link from \\"next/link\\";\\nimport { cn } from \\"@/lib/utils\\";\\nimport { usePathname } from \\"next/navigation\\";\\nimport { Combobox } from \\"../ui/combobox\\";\\nimport { type Project } from \\"@prisma/client\\";\\n\\ninterface Props {\\n  projects: Project[] | undefined;\\n  selectedProject: string;\\n  setSelectedProject: Dispatch<SetStateAction<string>>;\\n}\\n\\nconst items = [\\n  { name: \\"Dashboard\\", url: \\"/dashboard\\", icon: LayoutDashboard },\\n  { name: \\"Q&A\\", url: \\"/qa\\", icon: Bot },\\n  { name: \\"Meetings\\", url: \\"/meetings\\", icon: Presentation },\\n];\\n\\nconst AppSidebar = ({\\n  projects,\\n  selectedProject,\\n  setSelectedProject,\\n}: Props) => {\\n  const pathname = usePathname();\\n  const { open } = useSidebar();\\n  return (\\n    <Sidebar collapsible=\\"icon\\" variant=\\"floating\\">\\n      <SidebarHeader>\\n        <div\\n          className={`flex w-full items-center justify-center gap-2 ${open && \\"px-2\\"}`}\\n        >\\n          <Logo className=\\"h-8 w-auto\\" />\\n          {open && <h1 className=\\"text-2xl font-bold\\">LARK</h1>}\\n        </div>\\n      </SidebarHeader>\\n      <SidebarContent className={`${!open && \\"pt-3\\"}`}>\\n        <SidebarGroup>\\n          <SidebarGroupLabel>Application</SidebarGroupLabel>\\n          <SidebarGroupContent>\\n            <SidebarMenu>\\n              {items.map((item) => (\\n                <SidebarMenuItem key={item.name}>\\n                  <SidebarMenuButton asChild>\\n                    <Link\\n                      href={item.url}\\n                      className={cn(\\n                        {\\n                          \\"!bg-brand-blue-700 !text-white\\":\\n                            pathname === item.url,\\n                        },\\n                        \\"list-none hover:dark:bg-foundation-blue-800 hover:dark:text-neutral-50 focus:dark:bg-foundation-blue-800 focus:dark:text-neutral-50\\",\\n                      )}\\n                    >\\n                      <item.icon />\\n                      <span>{item.name}</span>\\n                    </Link>\\n                  </SidebarMenuButton>\\n                </SidebarMenuItem>\\n              ))}\\n            </SidebarMenu>\\n          </SidebarGroupContent>\\n        </SidebarGroup>\\n      </SidebarContent>\\n      <SidebarFooter className=\\"border-t-[1px] border-neutral-300 p-0\\">\\n        <div>\\n          <Combobox\\n            expanded={open}\\n            items={\\n              projects\\n                ? projects.map((project) => {\\n                    return {\\n                      value: project.id,\\n                      label: project.name,\\n                      backgroundColor: project.backgroundColor,\\n                    };\\n                  })\\n                : []\\n            }\\n            value={selectedProject}\\n            onChangeAction={setSelectedProject}\\n          />\\n        </div>\\n      </SidebarFooter>\\n    </Sidebar>\\n  );\\n};\\n\\nexport default AppSidebar;\\n"}, {"summary": "The React `Navbar` component renders a navigation bar using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

The sketch grid's creation and manipulation is handled primarily by three functions in `script.js`: `DefaultGridSize`, `UpdateGrid`, and `ResetGrid`.  Let's break down their logic:\n\n**1. `DefaultGridSize()`:**\n\nThis function is called initially (under certain conditions) to set up a default 16x16 grid.  It directly manipulates the CSS `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` properties of the element with the class "Grid" (defined in `index.html`).\n\n```javascript\nfunction DefaultGridSize() {\n  Grid.style.gridTemplateColumns = `repeat(16, 1fr)`;\n  Grid.style.gridTemplateRows = `repeat(16, 1fr)`;\n  UpdateGrid(16); // Calls UpdateGrid to populate the grid with divs\n  DefaultNum++; // Increments a counter to track if the default grid has been created\n}\n```\n\n**2. `UpdateGrid(Value)`:**\n\nThis is the core function responsible for generating and populating the grid. It takes a `Value` parameter representing the desired grid size (number of rows and columns).\n\n* **Resets the Grid:** It first clears any existing content within the grid using `ResetGrid()`.\n* **Sets Grid Dimensions:** It sets the grid's dimensions using `Grid.style.gridTemplateColumns` and `Grid.style.gridTemplateRows`, dynamically creating the grid layout based on the `Value`.\n* **Creates Grid Elements:** It iterates `Value * Value` times (to create all the grid cells), creating a new `div` element for each cell.  Each `div` is given the class "GridElement".\n* **Adds Event Listeners:**  Each `div` has two event listeners added:\n    * `mouseover`: Calls the `Brush` function (explained below).\n    * `mousedown`: Sets the background color of the clicked cell to `BrushColor` and adds the class "Brushed".\n* **Appends to Grid:** Each newly created `div` is appended to the `Grid` element.\n* **Sets Background Color:** `BackGroundColor(CurrentBGColor)` is called to set the background color of all the grid elements that are not yet "Brushed".\n\n```javascript\nfunction UpdateGrid(Value) {\n  Grid.style.gridTemplateColumns = `repeat(${Value}, 1fr)`;\n  Grid.style.gridTemplateRows = `repeat(${Value}, 1fr)`;\n  for (let j = 0; j < Value * Value; j++) {\n    const GridElement = document.createElement("div");\n    GridElement.classList.add("GridElement");\n    GridElement.addEventListener("mouseover", Brush);\n    GridElement.addEventListener("mousedown", (e) => {\n      e.target.style.backgroundColor = BrushColor;\n      e.target.classList.add("Brushed");\n    });\n    Grid.appendChild(GridElement);\n    BackGroundColor(CurrentBGColor);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**3. `ResetGrid()`:**\n\nThis function simply clears the contents of the grid element:\n\n```javascript\nfunction ResetGrid() {\n  Grid.innerHTML = "";\n}\n```\n\n**In summary:**  The grid is initially created by `DefaultGridSize()`, which calls `UpdateGrid()` with a size of 16.  The size can be changed dynamically using the slider, which triggers `UpdateSize()` and subsequently calls `GRID()`, which in turn uses `ResetGrid()` and `UpdateGrid()` to redraw the grid with the new size.  The `Brush` function handles the actual drawing on the grid elements.  The `Eraser` function modifies the behavior of the grid elements to allow erasing.\n	[{"summary": "The code implements a pixel art drawing grid with JavaScript.  It initializes default color and size values.  `DefaultGridSize` sets up a 16x16 grid. `Paint` sets `BrushColor` and makes the size slider visible. `CurrentMode` handles \\"Paint\\" and \\"Eraser\\" modes, switching the brush color accordingly. `UpdateSize` and `SizeValue` update the grid size and display the current size.  `UpdateGrid` dynamically generates grid elements with mouseover and mousedown event listeners for painting.  `Brush` applies color changes on mouseover, only when drawing. `ResetGrid` clears the grid.  Event listeners are attached to buttons for clearing, painting, and erasing functionalities. The eraser mode toggles element colors to the current background color. Input elements are used to set brush and background colors.  A draw state is maintained to only allow painting if the mouse is down.\\n", "fileName": "script.js", "similarity": 0.6228708016697314, "sourceCode": "//Defining constant default values on website load\\r\\nconst DefaultBrushColor = \\"black\\";\\r\\nconst DefaultBGColor = \\"white\\";\\r\\nconst DefaultBrushSize = 16;\\r\\n//---------------------------------------------------------//\\r\\nlet DefaultNum = 0;\\r\\nlet CMode = \\"Paint\\";\\r\\nlet BufferBrushColor = DefaultBrushColor;\\r\\nlet CurrentBGColor = DefaultBGColor;\\r\\nlet CurrentSize = DefaultBrushSize;\\r\\nlet PixelSize = document.querySelector(\\"#SizeSlider\\");\\r\\nlet SizeText = document.querySelector(\\"#SizeValue\\");\\r\\nlet Grid = document.querySelector(\\".Grid\\");\\r\\nlet BrushColor = DefaultBrushColor;\\r\\nlet ClearBtn = document.querySelector(\\".ClearBtn\\");\\r\\nlet EraserBtn = document.querySelector(\\".EraserBtn\\");\\r\\nlet BrushBtn = document.querySelector(\\".BrushBtn\\");\\r\\nlet ColorInput = document.querySelector(\\"#BrushColor\\");\\r\\nlet BGColorInput = document.querySelector(\\"#BGColor\\");\\r\\nfunction DefaultGridSize() {\\r\\n  Grid.style.gridTemplateColumns = `repeat(16, 1fr)`;\\r\\n  Grid.style.gridTemplateRows = `repeat(16, 1fr)`;\\r\\n  UpdateGrid(16);\\r\\n  DefaultNum++;\\r\\n}\\r\\nfunction Paint() {\\r\\n  if (DefaultNum < 1) {\\r\\n    DefaultGridSize();\\r\\n  }\\r\\n  BrushColor = BufferBrushColor;\\r\\n  PixelSize.classList.remove(\\"Hidden\\");\\r\\n  SizeText.classList.remove(\\"Hidden\\");\\r\\n  PixelSize.onchange = (e) => UpdateSize(e.target.value);\\r\\n  PixelSize.onmousemove = (e) => SizeValue(e.target.value);\\r\\n  BrushBtn.classList.add(\\"PaintMode\\");\\r\\n}\\r\\nfunction CurrentMode(Mode) {\\r\\n  if (Mode == \\"Paint\\") {\\r\\n    Paint();\\r\\n    EraserBtn.classList.remove(\\"ACTIVE\\");\\r\\n  } else if (Mode == \\"Eraser\\") {\\r\\n    BrushColor = CurrentBGColor;\\r\\n    Eraser();\\r\\n    BrushBtn.classList.remove(\\"PaintMode\\");\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\\r\\nfunction UpdateSize(value) {\\r\\n  CurrentSize = value;\\r\\n  GRID(CurrentSize);\\r\\n}\\r\\nfunction SizeValue(value) {\\r\\n  SizeText.innerHTML = `${value} x ${value}`;\\r\\n}\\r\\nlet draw = false;\\r\\nwindow.addEventListener(\\"mousedown\\", function () {\\r\\n  draw = true;\\r\\n});\\r\\nwindow.addEventListener(\\"mouseup\\", function () {\\r\\n  draw = false;\\r\\n});\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction UpdateGrid(Value) {\\r\\n  Grid.style.gridTemplateColumns = `repeat(${Value}, 1fr)`;\\r\\n  Grid.style.gridTemplateRows = `repeat(${Value}, 1fr)`;\\r\\n  for (let j = 0; j < Value * Value; j++) {\\r\\n    const GridElement = document.createElement(\\"div\\");\\r\\n    GridElement.classList.add(\\"GridElement\\");\\r\\n    GridElement.addEventListener(\\"mouseover\\", Brush);\\r\\n    GridElement.addEventListener(\\"mousedown\\", (e) => {\\r\\n      e.target.style.backgroundColor = BrushColor;\\r\\n      e.target.classList.add(\\"Brushed\\");\\r\\n    });\\r\\n\\r\\n    Grid.appendChild(GridElement);\\r\\n    BackGroundColor(CurrentBGColor);\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\\r\\nfunction ResetGrid() {\\r\\n  Grid.innerHTML = \\"\\";\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction GRID(Value) {\\r\\n  ResetGrid();\\r\\n  UpdateGrid(Value);\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction Brush(e) {\\r\\n  if (!draw) return;\\r\\n  e.target.style.backgroundColor = BrushColor;\\r\\n  e.target.classList.add(\\"Brushed\\");\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nClearBtn.addEventListener(\\"click\\", () => {\\r\\n  ResetGrid();\\r\\n  UpdateGrid(CurrentSize);\\r\\n});\\r\\n\\r\\nBrushBtn.addEventListener(\\"click\\", () => {\\r\\n  CMode = \\"Paint\\";\\r\\n  CurrentMode(CMode);\\r\\n});\\r\\n\\r\\nEraserBtn.addEventListener(\\"click\\", () => {\\r\\n  CMode = \\"Eraser\\";\\r\\n  CurrentMode(CMode);\\r\\n  console.log(CMode);\\r\\n});\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction Eraser() {\\r\\n  EraserBtn.classList.add(\\"ACTIVE\\");\\r\\n  const Elements = document.querySelectorAll(\\".Brushed\\");\\r\\n  for (let i = 0; i < Elements.length; i++) {\\r\\n    Elements[i].onclick = () => {\\r\\n      Elements[i].style.backgroundColor = CurrentBGColor;\\r\\n      Elements[i].classList.remove(\\"Brushed \\");\\r\\n    };\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\\r\\nColorInput.oninput = (e) => CurrentBrushColor(e.target.value);\\r\\nfunction CurrentBrushColor(Color) {\\r\\n  BrushColor = Color;\\r\\n  BufferBrushColor = Color;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nBGColorInput.oninput = (e) => BackGroundColor(e.target.value);\\r\\nfunction BackGroundColor(BGColor) {\\r\\n  CurrentBGColor = BGColor;\\r\\n  const Elements = document.querySelectorAll(\\".GridElement\\");\\r\\n  for (let i = 0; i < Elements.length; i++) {\\r\\n    if (!Elements[i].classList.contains(\\"Brushed\\")) {\\r\\n      Elements[i].style.backgroundColor = CurrentBGColor;\\r\\n    } else if (DefaultNum < 1) {\\r\\n      Grid.style.backgroundColor = CurrentBGColor;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\\r\\n"}, {"summary": "The HTML defines the structure of an Etch-A-Sketch web application.

likely `lazy.nvim`. It defines plugin specifications and keybindings, primarily for `neo-tree.nvim` and `telescope.nvim`. The `neo-tree` configuration sets visibility of filtered items.  `telescope.nvim` is configured with various built-in pickers (find_files, live_grep, buffers, help_tags, resume, diagnostics, treesitter) and custom keybindings.  File browser extensions include a custom file browser with modified normal and insert mode mappings, and general options for layout, sorting and themes.

It enables true color support and undercurls using terminal escape codes. It configures word wrap. An autocmd opens a diagnostic float on `CursorHold` events to display errors and sets `updatetime`. It also sets `scrolloff` to 0 and appends `node_modules/**` to the `wildignore` list, preventing the display of node_modules in autocompletions.

.gitignore for Neovim\n*.swp\n*.bak\n*.un~\n*.undo\n*.undo_tree\n	.gitignore	This `.gitignore` file specifies patterns to exclude certain files and directories from version control. Primarily, it targets files generated during development and testing, including test results (e.g., `*.tests`), debugging artifacts (e.g., `debug`), and temporary files like logs (`*.log`), and backup files (`*.swp`, `*.bak`, etc). Specific project files with the `foo.*` pattern are also excluded. The file also contains patterns specific to the Neovim editor such as `*.swp`.

bootstrap lazy.nvim, LazyVim and your plugins\n-- At the very top of your init.lua\nrequire("config.lazy")\n	init.lua	This Lua code snippet bootstraps a Neovim configuration. It leverages `lazy.nvim`, a plugin manager, to manage plugins. The `require("config.lazy")` line initiates the plugin loading process. This suggests a modular structure where plugin configurations are defined within the `config/lazy.lua` file.

snippet configures the `lualine.nvim` Neovim plugin.  It defines a table specifying the plugin's name and includes a dependency on `nvim-web-devicons`. The `opts` function, triggered during plugin initialization, receives the plugin's default options.

It defines a plugin specification, enabling, disabling, and configuring various plugins. Key components include: enabling `gruvbox` colorscheme, customizing `trouble.nvim` with diagnostic signs and disabling it, overriding `nvim-cmp` to include `cmp-emoji`, adding a Telescope keymap for finding plugin files and modifying Telescope defaults.  LSP configurations are set up for `pyright` and `tsserver`, the latter using `typescript.nvim` and defining keymaps.

For `noice.nvim`, it defines routes that skip notifications containing "No information available" and displays notifications via `notify_send` when the window loses focus. It adds a command with a `split` view for message history. Additionally, it sets a filetype autocmd for "markdown" to load markdown keys.

grid. It utilizes a functional component and TypeScript's interface for prop typing. The JSX employs Tailwind CSS classes to create a responsive grid layout, adjusting the number of columns across different screen sizes (5, 7, 10, and 13). The `matrix` is flattened before being mapped. Each element is displayed within a bordered, centered, and styled div, including a unique key based on its index.\n	cma80ce6k000m6rgzzb02srga

configures the `catgoose/nvim-colorizer.lua` Neovim plugin. It calls the `setup` function with configuration options.  It enables virtual text representation using "■" and activates Tailwind CSS color support.  The `user_default_options` table sets color parsing flags for various color formats, specifically enabling `tailwind`, `RGB`, and `RRGGBB` while disabling others.  The display `mode` is configured as `virtualtext` and `virtualtext_inline` is set to `before`. Finally, colorization is applied to all `filetypes` and `buftypes`.\n	cm9sgpwv5000p6cgh8liw7eua

`mason.nvim` and `nvim-lspconfig`. It installs language servers (e.g., bashls, eslint-lsp, jsonls, etc.) and formatters/linters (e.g., stylua, selene, prettier) via Mason.  `nvim-lspconfig` is configured with specific settings for `eslint`, including working directory and typescript project configuration, and implements auto-formatting.

Each table element represents a theme, including its name, priority, and configuration details. The `catppuccin/nvim` theme utilizes an `opts` function to set flavor and transparency.  `sainnhe/gruvbox-material`'s configuration directly sets global variables. `olimorris/onedarkpro.nvim` calls a setup function with style and transparency options, and `nobbmaestro/nvim-andromeda` relies on the `colorbuddy.nvim` dependency. Each theme is loaded with a high priority.\n	cm9sgpwv5000p6cgh8liw7eua

control. It begins by listing common log files (e.g., `*.log`, `npm-debug.log*`) and then excludes the `node_modules` and `dist` directories, as well as build output (`dist-ssr` and `*.local`).  Crucially, it targets editor-specific configurations like `.vscode`, `.idea` and associated files (`*.suo`, `*.ntvs*`, etc.), and system files like `.DS_Store`.

It installs treesitter parsers for various programming languages and file formats, including Astro, C++, Go, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and HTML. The configuration block sets up the installed parsers and registers custom filetypes, specifically enabling MDX support by associating the `.mdx` extension and files matching the `.tsx` pattern with the appropriate filetype.

`lazy.nvim`. It's a JSON object defining a set of plugins. Each entry represents a plugin and includes its name, branch, and commit hash. The structure uses a key-value pair format, where the plugin name is the key, and an object containing the branch and commit hash is the value.

{\n  {\n    "smjonas/inc-rename.nvim",\n    cmd = "IncRename",\n    config = true,\n  },\n}\n	lua/plugins/coding.lua	This Lua code snippet defines a configuration for a Neovim plugin manager, likely `packer.nvim` or a similar system. It specifies the installation and setup of the "smjonas/inc-rename.nvim" plugin. The code creates a table containing a single entry: a dictionary representing the plugin.

It utilizes `vim.keymap.set` and `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap` to define mappings for various actions. These actions include: navigating NeoTree, managing the clipboard (deleting to the black hole register), copying diagnostic messages, incrementing/decrementing numbers, deleting backwards, selecting all, navigating the jumplist, creating and navigating tabs, splitting and moving windows, resizing windows, switching buffers, and navigating diagnostics.  It also uses `which-key` and `flash` plugins to enable further advanced functionalities, such as advanced jumping.

It first checks if Lazy.nvim is installed; if not, it clones the repository from GitHub. Then, it prepends the Lazy.nvim runtime path to `rtp`. The `lazy.setup` function configures plugin loading.

code defines Neovim autocommands. It disables paste mode upon leaving insert mode for all filetypes. It then configures specific behavior for JSON and JSONC files, disabling spell checking and setting concealment level to zero. Finally, it sets the colorscheme to "gruvbox-material" when Neovim enters.

It fetches the user session using `api.auth.getSession.useQuery` from a TRPC endpoint.  While loading, it displays "Loading...". When a session exists, it renders the user's ID, a sign-out button utilizing `signOut` from `auth-client`, and the `CreateProjectForm` component. The `handleSignOut` function calls `signOut` and refetches the session using `refetch` to update the UI after signing out.

The `svg` tag establishes the drawing canvas with a viewport of 448x512 units. Four `rect` elements, representing windows, are positioned within this canvas.

It starts by creating an enumerated type "ProjectRole" with values 'MAINTAINER' and 'CONTRIBUTOR'.  Subsequently, it defines tables for users, sessions, accounts, and verifications, each with relevant attributes and primary keys.  It also defines tables for Projects, Members (linking users to projects with roles), and commits, including foreign key constraints establishing relationships between Users, Projects, Members, Sessions, Accounts, and commits.

specifies patterns for files and directories to be excluded from Git repository tracking. It ignores project dependencies in `node_modules`, `.pnp` and `.pnp.js` files, testing artifacts in `/coverage`, database files including SQLite related files, and Next.js build outputs within `/.next/` and `/out/`.

}\n	src/components/ui/tooltip.tsx	This React component library implements a tooltip using Radix UI primitives. It exports `Tooltip`, `TooltipTrigger`, `TooltipContent`, and `TooltipProvider`.  `TooltipContent` is a forwardRef component, wrapped within a `TooltipPrimitive.Portal`, and applies styling for visual presentation, including rounded corners, background color, and animations managed via `data-` attributes, such as `fade-in`, `zoom-in`, and `slide-in` effects. The component utilizes a utility function `cn` (likely for class name merging) to combine styles.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

retrieves a user session using `auth.api.getSession`, accessible to public users. `sendVerificationEmail`, a secure procedure, accepts an email and OTP input, validates the email format and OTP length using Zod. It then imports and utilizes a `node-mailer` transporter to send an OTP verification email. The procedure catches errors during email sending, throwing a TRPCError if unsuccessful.

It uses `zodResolver` to integrate Zod validation with the form. Upon submission, it calls `signIn.email` to authenticate the user and handles success/error messages via the `sonner` library.  The UI utilizes UI components such as `Button`, `Form`, and `FormInputField`.  A `useToggle` hook manages password visibility.

reusable, composable command palette component built upon `cmdk` and `radix-ui/react-dialog`. It leverages React's `forwardRef` for component ref forwarding.  The core `Command` component wraps `cmdk.CommandPrimitive`, styling the overall container. `CommandDialog` integrates the palette with a dialog component, using `DialogContent` from a UI library.  Individual elements like input (`CommandInput`), list (`CommandList`), empty state (`CommandEmpty`), group (`CommandGroup`), separator (`CommandSeparator`), and item (`CommandItem`) are also provided, wrapping their corresponding `cmdk` primitives and applying custom styling.

AppSidebar;\n	src/components/dashboard/AppSidebar.tsx	This React component, `AppSidebar`, renders a sidebar navigation UI using a custom `Sidebar` component. It integrates a logo, a navigation menu driven by an `items` array, and a `Combobox` for project selection.  The sidebar's visibility state is managed by `useSidebar`. Navigation links use Next.js's `Link` component, and the active route is highlighted using `cn` from `className` for conditional styling based on `usePathname`.  The project selection combobox fetches project data provided through props and utilizes  `setSelectedProject` to update the selected project.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

It exports components for constructing form elements. `Form` uses `FormProvider` from `react-hook-form`. `FormField` wraps `Controller` and provides a `FormFieldContext`.  `useFormField` retrieves form context and field state, exposing helper IDs. `FormItem` manages item-specific IDs via `FormItemContext`. `FormLabel`, `FormControl`, `FormDescription`, and `FormMessage`  are composed and styled using `cn` from `classnames`, incorporating field state and error handling by utilizing the `useFormField` hook and `aria-*` attributes for accessibility.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

`InputOTP` utilizes the `OTPInput` component from a library, applying styling and forward referencing.  `InputOTPGroup` provides a container for the input, also with styling and forward referencing.  `InputOTPSlot` renders each individual digit slot, leveraging `OTPInputContext` to access slot character, active state, and a fake caret.  `InputOTPSeparator` renders a visual separator (minus sign). All components employ `cn` from `@/lib/utils` for conditional class name application and are forwardRef-ed for external access.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

for a Next.js application. It enables strict type checking and utilizes ES2022 features. Key settings include `esModuleInterop`, `skipLibCheck`, `allowJs`, and `resolveJsonModule`.

It accepts a `control` object, a `name` prop for field registration, a `label`, and a `placeholder`.  It leverages the `FormField`, `FormItem`, `FormLabel`, `FormControl`, `FormMessage`, and `Input` components from a UI library. It conditionally renders a password toggle using `Eye` and `EyeOff` icons, based on `showPassword` and `onToggle` props.

It initializes default color and size values.  `DefaultGridSize` sets up a 16x16 grid. `Paint` sets `BrushColor` and makes the size slider visible. `CurrentMode` handles "Paint" and "Eraser" modes, switching the brush color accordingly. `UpdateSize` and `SizeValue` update the grid size and display the current size.  `UpdateGrid` dynamically generates grid elements with mouseover and mousedown event listeners for painting.  `Brush` applies color changes on mouseover, only when drawing. `ResetGrid` clears the grid.  Event listeners are attached to buttons for clearing, painting, and erasing functionalities. The eraser mode toggles element colors to the current background color. Input elements are used to set brush and background colors.  A draw state is maintained to only allow painting if the mouse is down.\n	cm9utb81e0005b60l3upxhr9o

It imports necessary modules: `StrictMode` and `createRoot` from `react` and `react-dom/client` respectively, along with the `App` component and a stylesheet.  `createRoot` targets the DOM element with the ID "root".

with Vite and TypeScript. The `index.html` defines the document's head and body. Crucially, it contains a root `div` with the ID "root," serving as the mount point for the React application.

It employs a PostgreSQL database (specified by `datasource db`) and generates a Prisma client.  The schema includes models for `User`, `Session`, `Account`, `Verification`, `Project`, `Member`, and `Commit`.  Relationships are defined using `@relation` and include one-to-many (User-Session, User-Account, User-Project, Project-Member, Project-Commit), and many-to-many (User-Project via Member).  Uniqueness constraints are established using `@@unique`.  `ProjectRole` is an enum.  `@default`, `@id`, `@unique`, and `@updatedAt` attributes are used.

It utilizes the `signUp.email` function (presumably from a client-side authentication library) to handle signup submission, and navigates to a verification page upon success.  State management uses `useState` for loading and `useToggle` for password visibility toggles.

`CreateProject` renders a creation interface within a `next/image` and a form component. It utilizes the `CreateProjectForm` component (defined elsewhere), positioned alongside an SVG image rendered by the `next/image` component, sourced from `/vectors/version-control.svg`. The layout employs a flex container, `h-full` and `w-full`, horizontally aligning items and vertically centering them, with a `px-36` padding.

default {\n  plugins: {\n    tailwindcss: {},\n  },\n};\n	postcss.config.js	This code configures a build tool, likely a framework like PostCSS or Webpack, using a JavaScript object. It defines a `plugins` property containing a configuration for integrating the Tailwind CSS plugin. The `tailwindcss` property, set to an empty object `{}`, signals the plugin's presence and default settings, indicating that Tailwind CSS will be processed during the build process.

It imports global styles, metadata, and Google font (DM_Sans). `metadata` sets the title, description, and icon. The `RootLayout` component renders an HTML structure including a `TRPCReactProvider` for tRPC, a `ThemeProvider` for managing themes, and `Toaster` for notifications. The layout applies the font, sets the language to "en", and includes styling for dark mode.  `StyledComponentsRegistry` is not used in the render but is likely to be there to support style components if they were needed.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

The root `<svg>` element sets the viewport and dimensions.  It utilizes `<g>` elements for grouping and transformations, creating a layered structure. Key components include: paths for shapes (lines, curves) filled with specific colors; rectangles for basic forms; and circles, also with fill colors.  The design includes an abstract figure composed of repeating shapes.  A design pattern is used by using `data-name` to name each component.  There are paths to describe the design.

It leverages `react-hook-form` for form management and `zod` for schema validation, enforcing rules for name, GitHub URL, and optional description and token.  The `zodResolver` integrates these libraries, ensuring form data validity.  The component utilizes a `trpc` mutation (`api.project.createProject`) to handle project creation, triggered upon form submission.  It displays loading states and uses `sonner` for user feedback via toast notifications on success or failure.  It uses custom `FormInputField` for input fields.

It utilizes TypeScript, Next.js's build process, linting, and formatting tools (Prettier, ESLint). Database interaction is managed by Prisma, including migrations and studio access. It leverages a wide array of dependencies, including React, UI components (Radix UI, Geist), state management (React Query), form handling (React Hook Form), and authentication (better-auth).

styled-components. The `Loader` component returns a `TextWrapper` styled `div` containing a `div` with the class "loader," housing two `span` elements.  The first `span` displays "LARK" with a transparent color and a stroke, while the second, also displaying "LARK," uses color and is animated via a CSS keyframes definition, `uiverse723`, which alters its `clip-path` property to achieve the animated effect, creating a visual loader.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

React from "react";\n\nconst Meetings = () => {\n  return <div>meetings</div>;\n};\n\nexport default Meetings;\n	src/app/(protected)/meetings/page.tsx	The React component `Meetings` is a functional component leveraging the `React` library. It defines a simple structure that renders a `div` element containing the text "meetings". This component acts as a placeholder, displaying a basic textual representation of the meetings area.

reusable Dialog component using the `@radix-ui/react-dialog` library. It re-exports primitives like `Root`, `Trigger`, `Portal`, `Close`, `Overlay`, and `Content`, while customizing the appearance and behavior. The `DialogOverlay` and `DialogContent` components use `forwardRef` to enable ref forwarding and applies CSS classes for styling and animations. The animations include fade-in/out, zoom, and slide effects based on the dialog's open/closed state.

It's a functional component utilizing `React.forwardRef` to provide a ref to the underlying Radix Separator primitive. It accepts `orientation` (horizontal or vertical) and `decorative` props, defaulting to horizontal and decorative.

It utilizes `SidebarProvider` for context management and `AppSidebar` for the actual sidebar UI.  It fetches user data and project information via the `useDashboard` hook. The component conditionally displays a `ProjectPlaceholder` if no projects exist or a project hasn't been selected, excluding the `/create-project` path.

`better-auth` library. It initializes an authentication instance leveraging a Prisma adapter for database interactions with PostgreSQL.  It enables email/password authentication and integrates social login providers: GitHub, Google, and Microsoft.  Each social provider utilizes a profile mapping function to extract and map user data (firstName, lastName). It also implements an `emailOTP` plugin for multi-factor authentication.

It fetches project data using `api.project.getProjects.useQuery`, handling loading and error states. `useLocalStorage` manages the `selectedProject` ID.

It utilizes `fill-rule="evenodd"` and `clip-rule="evenodd"` to define complex shapes through even-odd fill rules and clipping paths. The core structure features several filled paths with varying colors (`#89C5CC`, `#DDE3E9`, `#C1DEE2`, and `#69A1AC`) creating a visual representation of an irregular abstract form. Further detail is provided by clipping paths and opacity, rendering an artistic rendering.

It imports an authentication configuration object, `auth`, from a local file. The `toNextJsHandler` function from `better-auth/next-js` transforms this `auth` object into handlers that can process HTTP requests.  It exports `POST` and `GET` methods as API route handlers, allowing for handling of authentication-related requests, likely sign-in, sign-out or other functions.

It accepts optional `width`, `height`, and `className` props to customize its appearance. The component uses an SVG element with specified dimensions and a `viewBox` attribute. Within the SVG, four `path` elements define the logo's shape, filled with different colors using the `fill` attribute.

`Toaster`, leverages the `sonner` library to display notifications. It integrates with `next-themes` to dynamically set the toast theme based on the user's system preference. The component receives `sonner`'s props and applies them to a `Sonner` instance.  Styling is achieved via `className` and `toastOptions`, which override default styles, utilizing CSS class names for theming within the Next.js context, specifically tailoring colors for light/dark mode within groups `toaster` and `toast` for visual appearance.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

It initializes a `PrismaClient` with logging enabled based on the `NODE_ENV` environment variable; in development, it logs queries, errors, and warnings, while in production, it only logs errors. A global instance, `db`, is created, leveraging a global variable to persist the Prisma client across hot reloads during development. This prevents the recreation of the client on every request.

@type {import('prettier').Config & import('prettier-plugin-tailwindcss').PluginOptions} */\nexport default {\n  plugins: ["prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"],\n};\n	prettier.config.js	This code defines a Prettier configuration file, leveraging TypeScript for type safety. It exports an object extending both the standard `prettier.Config` and `prettier-plugin-tailwindcss.PluginOptions` interfaces. The core functionality lies within the `plugins` array, which explicitly includes `"prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"`.

unverified users and their associated credential accounts. The `POST` request first validates an authorization header against an API secret. It retrieves users created over 15 minutes ago who haven't verified their email using Prisma. The code iterates through these unverified users, deleting the user if they only have credential accounts, or deleting the credential account if social accounts exist alongside the credential one.

React from "react";\n\nconst page = () => {\n  return <div>page</div>;\n};\n\nexport default page;\n	src/app/(protected)/qa/page.tsx	The React code defines a functional component named `page` using arrow function syntax. This component simply returns a `div` element containing the text "page". It leverages the `React` library for UI definition.

It accepts a `session` object, a `hasFetchingError` boolean, a `setHasFetchingError` function, and a `name` string as props.  The component renders an `Avatar` component. If an image exists in `session.user.image` and `hasFetchingError` is false, it displays an `AvatarImage`; otherwise, it displays an `AvatarFallback` with the provided name.  The `onError` prop on the `AvatarImage` triggers `setHasFetchingError` if the image fails to load.  The layout uses a flexbox for positioning.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

It specifies dependencies for the "lark" workspace, including frontend frameworks (React, Next.js), styling libraries (Tailwind, Emotion, Radix UI), database/ORM (Prisma), state management (React Query, tRPC), authentication (Better Auth), and utility libraries (Zod, clsx). The `devDependencies` section lists tooling for TypeScript, ESLint, PostCSS, and other build-related tasks. The file extensively details the exact versions, shasums, and dependencies of all project packages.

ProjectPlaceholder;\n	src/components/dashboard/ProjectPlaceholder.tsx	The React component `ProjectPlaceholder` renders a visual placeholder when no project is selected. It utilizes Next.js's `Link` for internal navigation and `Image` component for displaying a vector graphic, specifically a "create project" icon.

`SocialProviders` component renders social login buttons for "sign in" or "sign up" flows. It utilizes an array `socialProviders` defining available providers (Google, Microsoft, GitHub), their corresponding React icons, and a `signIn.social` function. Each button, rendered via `.map()`, calls `handleSocialSignIn` on click, which triggers the `signIn.social` method with the provider name.  Error handling uses the `sonner` library's `toast.error` for displaying error messages.

avatar UI using Radix UI primitives. It utilizes `React.forwardRef` to expose underlying DOM elements. The `Avatar` component is the root, styled with rounded corners and size constraints, using the `cn` utility for conditional class application.  `AvatarImage` renders the avatar's image, ensuring a square aspect ratio.  `AvatarFallback` provides a default UI (bg-muted) if an image fails to load. Each component correctly forwards props and ref.  The library exports `Avatar`, `AvatarImage`, and `AvatarFallback` for use.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

It checks for Docker installation and daemon status. It attempts to start an existing stopped container or creates a new one. The script extracts database credentials (password and port) from a `.env` file. If the default password is used, it prompts the user to generate a new one, modifying the `.env` file accordingly.

{ handler } from "@/lib/edgestore";\n\nexport { handler as GET, handler as POST };\n	src/app/api/edgestore/[...edgestore]/route.ts	This code defines an API route using the Next.js framework. It imports a `handler` function from a file located at ` "@/lib/edgestore"`. This `handler` likely encapsulates the core logic for interacting with an Edge Store service. The code then exports the `handler` function, aliasing it as both `GET` and `POST`. This configuration indicates that the route supports HTTP GET and POST methods, delegating all requests to the imported `handler`.

It utilizes `Logo` component from a shared directory.  It fetches a session via `api.auth.getSession.useQuery` using tRPC.  Conditional rendering displays "Login" and "Sign Up" links when no session data exists, or "Dashboard" link when a session exists.

Next.js application. It leverages a `useDashboard` hook, likely a custom provider, to access dashboard-related data like user `session`, current `project`, a list of `projects`, the `selectedProject`, and a `setSelectedProject` function. It conditionally renders based on the availability of the dashboard data. If no projects exist, it renders a `ProjectPlaceholder` component; otherwise, it renders an empty `div`.

It utilizes the `@typescript-eslint/parser` and related plugins.  `parserOptions` specify a `project` and `tsconfigRootDir`. It extends from `next/core-web-vitals` and TypeScript-specific recommended configurations. The `rules` section customizes linting behavior.  Notable rules include disabling `array-type` and `consistent-type-definitions`, enforcing consistent type imports with inline style,  configuring  `no-unused-vars` to ignore underscore-prefixed arguments, and customizing `no-misused-promises` to suppress warnings for void return attributes.

EmailVerification;\n	src/components/EmailVerification.tsx	The React component `EmailVerification` implements email verification via OTP. It utilizes the `input-otp` library for OTP input, `sonner` for notifications, and `next/navigation` for routing.  It manages state for OTP input, a countdown timer, and loading indicators. The component interacts with an `emailOtp` service to send and verify OTPs.  `useEffect` hooks handle component mounting, timer initialization from local storage, and countdown logic. User input triggers `onSendOTPSubmit` to request an OTP and `verifyOTP` for verification.  A button initiates the OTP resend.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

 "files": [],\n  "references": [\n    { "path": "./tsconfig.app.json" },\n    { "path": "./tsconfig.node.json" }\n  ]\n}\n	tsconfig.json	This JSON configuration defines a basic project structure with TypeScript configuration files. It declares a project containing no source code files within the "files" array, indicating a potentially incomplete or build-only setup. The "references" array lists two TypeScript configuration files: `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json`. This structure suggests a split compilation strategy, likely involving separate configurations for application code and Node.js-specific code or dependencies, managed by the TypeScript compiler.

It initializes the client, specifying a base URL from environment variables and utilizing plugins `emailOTPClient` for email OTP authentication and `inferAdditionalFields` for type safety with the `auth` type.

defines a sheet component built with Radix UI primitives and class-variance-authority (cva). It exports `Sheet`, `SheetTrigger`, `SheetClose`, `SheetContent`, `SheetOverlay`, `SheetHeader`, `SheetFooter`, `SheetTitle`, and `SheetDescription`. `SheetContent` utilizes a `sheetVariants` function generated by cva, enabling side-based positioning (top, bottom, left, right) and applying animation classes for open/close transitions. `SheetOverlay` provides a backdrop using `SheetPrimitive.Overlay` with animation effects.  `SheetHeader`, `SheetFooter`, `SheetTitle` and `SheetDescription` are presentational components that structure content with styling.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

manage dashboard-related data. It fetches user session data and projects using `trpc` and a custom `useProject` hook. The component handles loading and error states, rendering a `LogoLoader` while data loads. Upon successful data retrieval, it provides the session, projects, the selected project, and a function to set the selected project via the context to its children.

It initializes a Gemini model instance using the API key from environment variables. The function constructs a prompt instructing the model to analyze the diff and generate concise commit messages, formatted as bullet points with file references.

It leverages `Popover` for the dropdown behavior,  `Command` for the selection list with search functionality, and `Button` for the trigger.  The component displays a list of items provided in the `items` prop, each containing a value, label, and optional background color. The `onChangeAction` prop handles the selection callback.  The component uses the `Avatar` component to display initials or a default folder icon if a selection is not made.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

`ThemeProvider` component leveraging the `next-themes` library. This component acts as a wrapper, inheriting all props from `NextThemesProvider`. Its primary function is to provide theming support to its children by passing down props to `NextThemesProvider` and rendering the children within.

It utilizes `useQueryClient` to access the query client instance. The hook returns an asynchronous function that, when invoked, calls `queryClient.refetchQueries` with the `type` option set to `"active"`.

It accepts `digrams` (string array) and `title` (string) as props. The component uses a functional component (`React.FC`) and destructures the props. The JSX renders a title and iterates through the `digrams` array using `.map()`. Each digram is displayed within a styled `div` element, assigned a unique key via index `i`.  Styling is implemented using Tailwind CSS classes for layout, font, and background.\n	cma80ce6k000m6rgzzb02srga

The paths depict stylized, three-dimensional-like forms suggesting a set of stacked, partially transparent shapes. Each path uses the `d` attribute to specify a complex shape using a series of moveto, lineto, and curveto commands. The shapes are colored with `fill` attributes, using the hexadecimal color codes. The use of different fill colors and overlapping creates a layered effect.

It fetches the user's session using a `trpc` server call.  The UI displays a logo via the `Logo` component, a header, and instructions.  Conditionally rendering, it presents an `EmailVerification` component, passing the user's email and verification status when a session is found.

It leverages the `cn` function from a local `utils` module for conditional class name concatenation, likely managing Tailwind CSS classes. The component accepts standard HTML attributes via `React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>`. Its core functionality renders a `div` element.

two Zod schemas for user authentication. `signUpSchema` validates user registration data, including email (valid email format), password (minimum 8 characters), confirmation password, first name (minimum 2 characters), and an optional last name (minimum 2 characters). It utilizes `refine` to ensure password and confirmPassword match, customizing the error message and path. `signInSchema` validates sign-in data, requiring only an email (valid format) and a password.

using `trpc`. The `migrateImage` procedure, accessible only to authenticated users, accepts `userId`, `provider`, and `externalUrl` as input. It uses `backendClient.profile.upload` to upload the image from the `externalUrl` to a backend service, likely an object store.

It accepts props for key phrase, plaintext, encrypted/decrypted texts, and functions for matrix generation (`matrixFunction`), encryption (`encryptMessage`), and decryption (`decryptMessage`). The `handleEncrypt` function, triggered by a button, generates a 7x13 matrix using the key phrase and character set. It then uses the matrix to encrypt the provided plaintext using `encryptMessage` and subsequently decrypts the resulting ciphertext using `decryptMessage`. Errors from matrix generation are displayed in an alert. Finally, it updates the `encrypted` and `decrypted` states, displaying results conditionally.

It leverages a `DashboardProvider` to manage dashboard-related context and a `DashboardLayout` component to structure the user interface. The `SidebarLayout` accepts `children` as a prop, rendering them within the `DashboardLayout`.

}\n	src/components/ui/label.tsx	The React code defines a reusable `Label` component using Radix UI's `LabelPrimitive` and `class-variance-authority` (cva) for styling. The `labelVariants` constant utilizes `cva` to define base and disabled state styles, managing text size, font, and opacity. The `Label` component, a forward ref, wraps `LabelPrimitive.Root`, applying the combined styles from `labelVariants` and any provided `className`.  It supports all `LabelPrimitive.Root` props.  The `cn` utility function (imported from "@/lib/utils") likely handles class name merging. The component's display name is set for debugging purposes.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

It utilizes Tailwind CSS for utility classes. Root-level variables set default font properties, color scheme, and background color, primarily targeting a dark theme. A universal selector (*) applies a `transition` effect to all elements, providing a smooth animation with a 0.7-second duration and `ease-in-out` timing function across all CSS properties.

It enables dark mode based on CSS classes. It customizes the theme by extending existing configurations. Key customizations include defining a `caret-blink` animation, overriding the `sans` font family to include `var(--font-geist-sans)`, setting custom border radius values, and defining extensive color palettes with multiple shades for various UI elements and brand colors.

creates a project record in the database along with a member entry for the creator. It then calls `pollCommits` asynchronously. The `getProjects` query retrieves projects associated with the authenticated user, filtering by non-deleted projects.

generated by a Crashpad client on a Windows system. Repeated "not connected" errors, originating from `crashpad_client_win.cc`, at line 810 or 811, indicate a failure in the crash reporting service’s connection to the Crashpad server.

`createQueryClient`, that initializes a `QueryClient` from the `@tanstack/react-query` library. The client configures default query options, setting a `staleTime` of 30 seconds to prevent immediate refetching on the client-side during Server-Side Rendering (SSR). It customizes dehydration using `SuperJSON` for data serialization, extending `defaultShouldDehydrateQuery` to include pending queries for dehydration.

It imports `defineConfig` from Vite and plugin modules for React and Tailwind CSS.

default App;\n	src/App.tsx	The React component `App` implements a Playfair cipher visualizer. It uses `useState` hooks to manage the cipher matrix, plaintext, key phrase, encrypted, and decrypted text.  `useEffect` regenerates the matrix when the key phrase changes, utilizing a `keyMatrix` function from `playfair.ts`. The component renders a `CipherForm` for user input and dynamically displays the matrix and digrams (plaintext, encrypted, decrypted) using `MatrixDisplay` and `DigramDisplay` components.  Encryption/decryption are handled by functions imported from `playfair.ts`. The code uses a filler character to handle plaintext length and digram creation.\n	cma80ce6k000m6rgzzb02srga

(variables) using the `@tailwind` directives and `@layer base`. It sets color and styling variables (background, foreground, primary, etc.) for both light and dark themes, specified within the `:root` and `.dark` selectors.  These variables are primarily color definitions, likely for a theming system. The code also applies a global border style and sets the body's background and text color using the defined variables.

It uses `betterFetch` to retrieve session data. It intercepts requests based on defined `authRoutes` and the requested pathname. Signed-in users are redirected from signup/signin pages to the root. Unauthenticated users are redirected to /sign-in from /dashboard. For the /sign-up/verification route, it redirects unverified users to /sign-up, or verified ones to /dashboard.

It defines a `createContext` function to generate request-specific tRPC context utilizing `createTRPCContext` and request headers. The `handler` function uses `fetchRequestHandler` to manage tRPC requests, mapping incoming `NextRequest` to the `appRouter`.

The `#root` element is centered with a maximum width. `.logo` styles an image, including height, padding, and hover effects with drop shadows, specifically adapting for React's logo.  A `logo-spin` keyframe animates rotation.  A media query applies the animation to the second link's logo when reduced motion is not preferred.

It accepts `name`, `size`, `className`, and `backgroundColor` props.  `useMemo` optimizes initial computation.  It extracts initials from the `name`. If `name` is absent, it returns an empty string. The component dynamically generates a random, visually appropriate background color using HSL.

UI primitives. It re-exports `PopoverPrimitive.Root`, `PopoverPrimitive.Trigger`, and `PopoverPrimitive.Anchor`. The `PopoverContent` component, a React forward ref, renders the popover's content using `PopoverPrimitive.Content` within a `Portal` for positioning control. It styles the content with CSS classes from the `cn` utility for theming and animation, including transitions for open/close states and side positioning.

It accepts standard input props and a `className` prop for styling.  The component employs the `cn` utility (likely from a CSS-in-JS library like `class-variance-authority`) to conditionally apply a base style and any additional classes.

application. It specifies ES2020 as the target ECMAScript version and includes DOM and iterable libraries. Module resolution is set to "bundler" for efficient module handling. The configuration emphasizes strict type checking and linting rules, enabling `strict` mode and enforcing unused variable/parameter and fallthrough case checks.

It leverages `class-variance-authority` (cva) to manage styling variations, using `buttonVariants` to apply different styles based on `variant` (default, destructive, etc.) and `size` (default, sm, lg, icon) props. It uses `cn` (likely a utility for class name concatenation). The component accepts standard `HTMLButtonElement` attributes and custom `ButtonProps` (including `variant`, `size`, and `asChild`). The `asChild` prop allows rendering the button as a `Slot` component from `@radix-ui/react-slot`, enabling flexible integration. The component utilizes `React.forwardRef` for ref forwarding and returns a button element (or a `Slot` if `asChild` is true) with dynamically generated class names.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

It utilizes the `useState` hook to manage the boolean value, initialized to `initialValue` (defaults to `false`). The `useCallback` hook memoizes the `toggle` function, ensuring referential stability. The `toggle` function updates the state by inverting the current value using a functional update for atomicity. The hook returns an array containing the current boolean value and the memoized toggle function.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

It targets ES2022 with ES2023 libraries, utilizing the ESNext module system and a bundler module resolution strategy.  `skipLibCheck` is enabled, along with isolated modules and enforced module detection.

It utilizes a `MOBILE_BREAKPOINT` constant (768px) for this assessment. The hook leverages `matchMedia` to monitor viewport width changes.  A `useEffect` hook initializes the mobile state based on the initial viewport width and attaches an event listener to `matchMedia`'s `change` event. The `onChange` callback updates the state with the current result of the comparison. Finally, the hook returns a boolean indicating mobile status after component mount.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

It imports `initializeApp`, `getAnalytics`, and `getStorage` from the Firebase SDK.  `firebaseConfig` stores Firebase app configuration using environment variables.  `initializeApp` uses this configuration to initialize a Firebase app instance, `app`.

image storage, leveraging the EdgeStore library and Zod for input validation. It initializes an EdgeStore instance (`es`) and then creates a router (`edgeStoreRouter`) that defines a `profile` bucket. The `profile` bucket accepts input containing `user` and `provider` strings, using Zod for type validation. The path is determined by these input values. A Next.js app handler (`handler`) is created using `createEdgeStoreNextHandler`, exposing the router's functionality.

code configures ESLint for TypeScript projects. It leverages `@eslint/js`, `typescript-eslint`, `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`, and `eslint-plugin-react-refresh`. The configuration ignores the `dist` directory and extends recommended configurations from `js` and `typescript-eslint`. It targets `*.ts` and `*.tsx` files, sets the ECMAScript version to 2020, and defines browser globals.  It then integrates `react-hooks` and `react-refresh` plugins, including `react-hooks`'s recommended rules.

state using `localStorage` and `react-query`. It leverages `useQuery` to fetch a stored end time, calculating initial seconds remaining based on the stored time. `useMutation` updates `localStorage` and the query cache to store or clear the end time. `useEffect` sets an interval to decrement `secondsLeft`, stop the timer at zero, and clear the storage.  The hook exposes `start` to initialize or reset the timer and `stop` to reset the counter.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

interactions. It utilizes `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching and caching. `createQueryClient` creates a query client, with a singleton implementation for the browser to maintain a consistent client instance.  `createTRPCReact` instantiates the tRPC client, and `TRPCReactProvider` integrates this client, providing the tRPC client and the react-query client through context. The provider also sets up links, including a logger for development and HTTP batch streaming with `superjson` for serialization to handle requests. `getBaseUrl` determines the API endpoint dynamically based on environment.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

code defines a tRPC integration for a Next.js application, designed for server-side rendering (RSC). It establishes a server-only execution environment. `createTRPCContext` initializes the tRPC context, incorporating headers and authorization via `process.env.API_SECRET`. The `createQueryClient` creates a query client, and `createCaller` instantiates a tRPC caller.  `createHydrationHelpers` generates utility functions (`api` for API calls, and `HydrateClient` for hydration) while leveraging `cache` for performance. `getCaller` dynamically imports and returns `createCaller`.\n	cm9sh51o3001z6cghc20vu57r

CSS code defines the styling for a web application. It sets the background color and uses the "Nerko One" font.  Key elements are structured using `display: flex` and `display: grid` for layout.

It includes a heading, a menu, and a grid container. The menu features color pickers for brush and background, "Paint," "Eraser," and "Clear" buttons, and a size slider, initially hidden.  External CSS (`styles.css`) and JavaScript (`script.js`) files are linked. The `script.js` likely handles user interactions to control the grid color and dimensions, based on the inputs and buttons.\n	cm9utb81e0005b60l3upxhr9o
